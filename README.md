## Description

### /TSP:
 - *__tsp.py__*: tsp solver with custom 'heuristic' permutation (not working very well)
 - *__tsp_inverover.py__*: tsp solver with pure ga (generations + inver-over + elitism) (**works definitely better**))

### /Connect4:
 - *__C4.py__*: connect-4 minmax (with alpha-beta pruning + hard cut-off) + montecarlo solver
